# rock_paper_scissors

First project using Javascript.
The idea of this project is to practice using basic Javascript by creating a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

In this game, a human will be playing against the computer on teh console.
The game dos NOT have a user interface other than a prompt.

*There's still an "error" in the game:
    If you type something different than "rock", "paper" or "scissors", the game still counts it as a round.
